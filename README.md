# P99 Wiki Parser
Parse data from the P99 wiki - Ideally to be used by Twitch Bots

## Aspirations

Allow a twitch bot to accept the command !quest [itemname] and have it search the P99 wiki for that item & quest item names and/or links

## Current Status

Parses the Goblin Warlord Beads page & prints out the text for the quest

Currently runs with Python 3.7

Requirements: 
- beautifulsoup4
